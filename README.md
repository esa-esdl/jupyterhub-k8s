# jupyterhub-k8s

A full instruction on how to deploy Jupyterhub with Kubernetes is available [here](https://zero-to-jupyterhub-with-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This repository is more of a documentation on what has been done in regards to Jupyterhub deployment for ESDL project. The scripts and configurations are created specifically for this purpose. 

## Deployment at GKE

All the commands below are to be executed inside Google Cloud Shell. 

#### Pre-requisites
* Create a project in GCP by first clicking the project list button at the top toolbar, and then click `new project`
  ![Alt text](docs/gcp-create-project.png?raw=true "Create a new project in GCP")
* When using Kubernetes Engine for the first time, you may need to activate Kubernetes Engine API. This is done by selecting `Kubernetes Engine` and there should be an activate button somewhere on the page.

#### Create a cluster
* `git clone https://github.com/esa-esdl/jupyterhub-k8s.git`
* `cd jupyterhub-k8s/scripts`
* `./create_clusters.sh`

#### Install and Start Jupyterhub
* `vim config.yaml`
  * `proxy.secretToken`: generate the [secret token](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html?highlight=secrettoken#proxy-secrettoken)
  * `proxy.service.loadBalancerIP`: reserve a static IP address and use its value (in GCP: go to Networking > VPC network > External IP addresses, and then click `reserve static address`)
  * `proxy.https.hosts`: select a host name (this will then need to be tied to the static IP address)
  * `proxy.https.letsencrypt.contactEmail`: an email address to which an expiry notice will be sent
  * `auth.admin.users`: list of GitHub usernames that will have admin role
  * `auth.whitelist.users`: list of GitHub usernames that are allowed access to the Jupyterhub
  * `auth.github.[clientId|clientSecret|callbackUrl]`: information required for OAuth using [GitHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub-with-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html?highlight=github#github)
* `./initialize-helm.sh`
* `./install-jupyterhub.sh`
* `kubectl -n jupyterhub get all` -> _to check if installation has been successful. Ensure that none of the pods or services indicates some errors. It may take a while until all the Kubernetes objects are up and running._

#### Upgrade Jupyterhub after configuration changes
* `helm upgrade jupyterhub-kube jupyterhub/jupyterhub --version=v0.8-e29f3e7 -f config.yaml`
	
#### Stop and remove Jupyterhub (also remove cluster)
* `./remove-jupyterhub-kube.sh`
* `gcloud container clusters delete jupyterhub-kubernetes --zone=europe-west3-a`
	
#### Create NFS server (for the datacube)
* In order to be able to run `download-esdl-cube.sh` script to download the datacube to the NFS server, please create a custom NFS Server Docker image. Instruction is available at the [readme](https://github.com/esa-esdl/jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/scripts/nfs/nfs-wget/README.md). And then, modify the image name in `nfs-server-rc.yaml` to use the new image name. 
* `cd nfs`
* `./create-datacube-volume.sh`
* `./create-nfs-server.sh`
* `kubectl -n jupyterhub describe service nfs-server`
  * copy the value of `IP` field, to be used on the next step
* `vim nfs-pv.yaml`
  * update the value of `spec.nfs.server` to use the value from the previous step
* `./create-nfs-volume.sh`
	
#### Upload existing Docker images to GCR
* follow this instruction: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling
  * for authentication, run `gcloud auth login` and then follow the instructions
